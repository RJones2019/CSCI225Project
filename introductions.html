                    Rakeem is known as Ghost. He started gaming at the age of 3 on 
                    the Playstation 2 on 007 Agent Under Fire. He became interested
                    in competitive gaming when he started watching SSSniperwolf play
                    Overwatch: Origins Edition as well as Faze Clan with Call of Duty Black Ops 2
                    Currently Ghost and the rest of Aviator are ranked in the Top 10 for 
                    ESports teams in America. Ghost's setup is his Playstation 5 console,
                    Acer Predator X27 Monitor, Playstation 5 Scuf Reflex Gaming Controller,
                    and Playstation 3D Pulse Headset. When asked about his favorite aspect
                    of gaming, he mentioned his love for hearing kids rage when they're trolled online.
                    His video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bCo4Mh7nnw&t=19s&ab_channel=AVAGhost">"TROLLING ON BLACK OPS: KID RAGES!!"</a>
                    is his all time favorite.

                Payton is known as Phantom. While he might look like your 
                average gamer, he's certainly out ranks the other players he
                encounters online. One thing you might notice is that each of
                our players use different gaming platforms. Due to the new 
                structure of modern gaming, most games are now supporting
                cross platform support, such means that each player can play on
                what they feel comfortable. Phantom's console of choice is the Xbox Series X
                with the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 and Xbox Wireless Headset.
                Phantom also games using the Acer Predator X27 Monitor as this is the 
                closest to competitive performance when used in competitions.

                Scott is known as Ziel. While he's new to the gaming scene,
                he quickly became adapt to the fast pace physics that makes
                competitive gameplay exciting to play and watch. On the otherside of
                his computer screen, Ziel is pursing his degree in Applied Computer Science
                But when he's ready to game, he's busy playing League of Legends on his
                iBuyPower Gaming Desktop. His computer is equipped with an 
                Intel Core i7-12700KF CPU, GeForce RTX 3070 Ti 8GB GPU,
                16GB DDR4-3600 RGB RAM, 1TB M.2 NVMe SSD, and iBuy Power 240MM RGB Liquid Cooler
                He also uses a Razer Huntsman V2 Keyboard with a Razer Basilisk V3 Gaming Mouse
                To view the content from that powerful machine, he uses a BENQ Mobiuz 165Hz 2k 
                Curved Gaming Monitor at 31.5 inches. As every gamer knows, 
                the perfect headset is just as needed as the GPU or Keyboard. This is why
                Ziel only uses Astro gaming headsets to deliver the best sound quality
                during competitions, and the Astro A50 Wireless Headset does an excellent job at 
                insuring that those footsteps on Nuketown are heard to keep in him the game!
